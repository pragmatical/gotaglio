# Planning

This folder holds planning documents for features and improvements. These docs are written to be Copilot-friendly so they can be used to drive implementation directly.

Recommended conventions:
- One feature per file, named with a short slug and date: `yyyy-mm-dd-short-slug.md`
- Start from the template in `feature-plan-template.md`
- Keep actionable checklists up to date; Copilot will use them to track progress

Suggested workflow:
1. Copy `feature-plan-template.md` to a new file in this folder
2. Fill in the sections with enough detail for implementation
3. Link to impacted files in the repo using backticks (e.g., `gotaglio/pipeline.py`)
4. When implementing, reference the plan from PR descriptions
