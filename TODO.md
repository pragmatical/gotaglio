* Design note about coercing types of a=b command line parameters.
  * It seems like argparse can't help here as it doesn't know about the type.
  * Perhaps pydantic can help. It might also help with invalid keys.

## Service

* schemas
    GET returns a list of schemas
    POST creates a new schema and returns its id
* schemas/id
    GET returns the schema description
    DELETE
    Schemas are immutable
    The schema defines the type system for is cases
* schemas/id/cases
    GET returns all cases or those matching query
    POST schemas/id/cases creates a new case and returns its id
* schemas/id/aschemas
    GET returns a list of annotation-schemas
    POST creates a new annotation-schema and returns its id
    The annotation-schema contains templates for the cases and the annotation create/edit form
* schemas/id1/aschems/id2/
    GET returns all annotations or those matching query
    POST creates a new annotation-schema
